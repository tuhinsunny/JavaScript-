# Javascript and Classes

## OOP

## Object
- Collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Why use OOP?

## Parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new , this)

 
## 4 pillars

The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript are:

- Abstraction: This principle involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. In JavaScript, abstraction can be achieved using constructor functions or classes. It allows you to reduce programming complexity and effort.

- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved using classes where properties and methods are defined. This principle also helps in data hiding, as JavaScript supports scope-based access modifiers like public, private, and protected through newer syntax.

- Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behavior (methods) from another class. In JavaScript, inheritance can be implemented using prototype-based inheritance or the extends keyword in ES6 classes. This allows for the creation of a parent-child relationship where subclasses can inherit and extend the functionalities of a superclass.

- Polymorphism: Polymorphism means "many shapes" in Greek. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In JavaScript, polymorphism can be achieved through overriding methods in subclasses, allowing a method to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. This is useful for code reusability and flexibility.
