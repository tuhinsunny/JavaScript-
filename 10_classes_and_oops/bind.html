<!-- The use of this.handleClick.bind(this) in the event listener ensures that when handleClick is called in response to a button click, it retains the correct context (this refers to the instance of the React class), allowing it to access the class properties like this.server. Without .bind(this), this inside handleClick would refer to the button element (the source of the event), not the React class instance, and attempting to access this.server would result in undefined. -->
